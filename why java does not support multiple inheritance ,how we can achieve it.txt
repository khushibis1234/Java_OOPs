
Why Multiple Inheritance Is Not Supported in Java
Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java for simplicity and to avoid problems like the Diamond Problem.

1. The Diamond Problem
The Diamond Problem occurs when:

A class inherits from two parent classes that have a common ancestor.
The child class inherits conflicting methods or behaviors, creating ambiguity about which method to execute.
Example of the Diamond Problem in pseudo-code:

java
Copy
Edit
class A {
    void display() { System.out.println("A"); }
}

class B extends A {
    void display() { System.out.println("B"); }
}

class C extends A {
    void display() { System.out.println("C"); }
}

// If Java allowed this:
class D extends B, C {
    // Ambiguity: Should D use B's or C's display()?
}
To avoid this complexity and ambiguity, Java restricts multiple inheritance with classes.

2. Complexity in Maintenance
Allowing multiple inheritance increases the complexity of code maintenance and debugging.
It can lead to unexpected behaviors when multiple parent classes define methods with the same signature.
3. Javaâ€™s Design Philosophy
Java was designed to be simple, secure, and maintainable. By supporting only single inheritance for classes, Java eliminates potential confusion and makes the inheritance hierarchy clear.

How to Achieve Multiple Inheritance in Java Using Interfaces
Java allows multiple inheritance through interfaces because interfaces define only method signatures (until Java 8). Since no implementation is provided, there's no conflict of behavior.
