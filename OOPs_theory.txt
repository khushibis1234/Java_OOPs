Java OOps Concept

In this section, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, such as Object,class inheritance,polymorphism,abstraction,encapsulation.

Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a pure object-oriented programming language.

Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.

Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:

Coupling
Cohesion
Association
Aggregation
Composition

Advantage of OOPs over Procedure-Oriented Programming Language
1) OOPs makes development and maintenance easier, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size increases.

2) OOPs provides data hiding, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, global data can be accessed from anywhere.

3) OOPs provides the ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the solution of real word problem if we are using the Object-Oriented Programming language.

What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and object-based programming language?
Object-based programming language follows all the features of OOPs except Inheritance. JavaScript and VBScript are examples of object-based programming languages.
