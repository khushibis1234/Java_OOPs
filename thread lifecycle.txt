1. New Thread:

Figure: Life Cycle of a thread

 When a new thread is created, it is in the new state.
 The thread has not yet started to run when thread is in this state.
 When a thread lies in the new state, it’s code is yet to be run and hasn’t started to
execute.
2. Runnable State:
 A thread that is ready to run is moved to runnable state.
 In this state, a thread might actually be running or it might be ready run at any instant
of time.

 It is the responsibility of the thread scheduler to give the thread, time to run.
 A multi-threaded program allocates a fixed amount of time to each individual thread.
Each and every thread runs for a short while and then pauses and relinquishes the CPU
to another thread, so that other threads can get a chance to run. When this happens,
all such threads that are ready to run, waiting for the CPU and the currently running
thread lies in runnable state.
3. Blocked/Waiting state:
 When a thread is temporarily inactive, then it’s in one of the following states:
4. Timed Waiting:
 A thread lies in timed waiting state when it calls a method with a time out parameter.
 A thread lies in this state until the timeout is completed or until a notification is
received.
 For example, when a thread calls sleep or a conditional wait, it is moved to timed
waiting state.
5. Terminated State:
 A thread terminates because of either of the following reasons:
○ Because it exits normally.
