Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

The idea behind inheritance in Java is that we can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When we inherit methods from an existing class, we can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. However, we can add new methods and fields in your current class also.
