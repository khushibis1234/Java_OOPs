Advantages of Java Multithreading
1) It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the same time.

2) You can perform many operations together, so it saves time.

3) Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.

4) Multithreading can significantly enhance the performance of applications by making better use of multiple CPU cores. Each thread can run on a separate core, allowing for parallel processing and faster execution of tasks.

5) In applications with a graphical user interface (GUI), multithreading can help keep the interface responsive. Long-running tasks can be handled in the background by separate threads, preventing the main thread from freezing and improving user experience.

6) Threads within the same process share the same memory and resources, which makes it easier to share data between them without the need for complex inter-process communication mechanisms.

7) Using multiple threads can simplify the design of complex applications, allowing for more modular and manageable code. For example, separate threads can be dedicated to different tasks, such as network communication, file I/O, and computation.

8) Multithreading allows an application to continue processing while waiting for I/O operations to complete. This leads to better utilization of CPU resources as threads can perform useful work during I/O waits.

Multitasking
Multitasking is a process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously. We use multitasking to utilize the CPU. Multitasking can be achieved in two ways:

Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)
Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)
1) Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)
Each process has an address in memory. In other words, each process allocates a separate memory area.
A process is heavyweight.
Cost of communication between the process is high.
Switching from one process to another requires some time for saving and loading registers, memory maps, updating lists, etc.
2) Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)
Threads share the same address space.
A thread is lightweight.
Cost of communication between the thread is low.
